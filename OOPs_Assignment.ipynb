        "\n",
        "Ans:Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that focuses on creating and using objects to design and structure software. Each object is built from a class (a blueprint) and contains attributes (data) and methods (functions that define behavior). OOP follows four main principles: Encapsulation (bundling data and methods together while controlling access), Inheritance (allowing a class to acquire properties and behaviors from another class), Polymorphism (enabling one interface or method to work in different ways), and Abstraction (hiding complex details and showing only essential features). This method makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain, especially for large and complex projects.\n"

For example, you can use a car’s steering and accelerator without knowing the mechanics behind them. **Encapsulation**, on the other hand, means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to the data to protect it from unwanted changes. This is usually done using access modifiers like private, protected, and public, along with getter and setter methods. In simple terms, abstraction hides *implementation details*, while encapsulation hides *data* and ensures controlled access.\n"

They are automatically called by Python to perform specific operations, allowing you to define how objects of your class should behave in different situations. For example, `__init__` runs when an object is created, `__str__` defines what is shown when you print the object, and `__len__` specifies the result of the `len()` function. By using dunder methods, you can make your custom classes behave like Python’s built-in types and provide more intuitive and readable code.\n"

This allows the child class to change or customize the behavior inherited from the parent class. Method overriding is possible only through **inheritance** and is mainly used to achieve **runtime polymorphism**, where the method that gets executed is determined by the type of object calling it. For example, if a parent class `Animal` has a `speak()` method and a child class `Dog` overrides it to produce a barking sound, then calling `speak()` on a `Dog` object will execute the overridden version in the `Dog` class instead of the one in `Animal`.\n"

        "With polymorphism, you can write a single piece of code (like a function or loop) that can operate on objects from different classes, as long as they implement the required method.

This is the essence of **runtime polymorphism**, and it helps in building cleaner, more modular, and adaptable software systems.\n"

        "\n",
        "While `__del__` can be used for cleanup, a more recommended approach for resource management is the `with` statement, which uses a **context manager**. A context manager, implemented with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, provides a more reliable and deterministic way to release resources. The `__del__` method's execution is not guaranteed, as it depends on the garbage collector, which may not run immediately or at all, especially when the program is exiting.\n",

        "It's important to be aware of the limitations of `__del__`:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Unpredictable Timing**: Python's garbage collector determines when `__del__` is called, so you can't rely on it to run at a specific time. An object might persist for a long time after it is no longer referenced.\n",
        "* **Potential for Errors**: Errors that occur within `__del__` are suppressed and can be difficult to debug.\n",
        "* **Circular References**: Objects involved in a circular reference might not be garbage-collected, and their `__del__` method will never be called. This is a significant reason why `__del__` is not a reliable cleanup mechanism for all scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to these limitations, Python's documentation generally advises against using `__del__` for critical cleanup tasks. The `with` statement and context managers are the preferred and safer alternative."

        "ans:Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This means you can write code that works with a generic parent class, and the specific behavior for each child class is executed automatically.

        "Polymorphism works in Python through **method overriding** and **duck typing**.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Method Overriding**: When a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class, it's called method overriding. When this method is called on an object, Python's runtime determines the correct version of the method to execute based on the object's actual class, not the variable's type.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Duck Typing**: This is a core principle of polymorphism in Python. The philosophy is: \"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.\" In programming terms, if an object has the methods and attributes required to perform an action, it can be used, regardless of its actual class. Python doesn't check the object's type at compile time; it only checks if the necessary method exists at runtime. This allows for great flexibility.\n",

        "\n",
        "ans:Method chaining is a programming technique in Python where multiple method calls are strung together on a single line. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (`self`), allowing another method to be called on the result of the previous one. This creates a fluent, readable, and concise syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "-----\n",
        "\n",
        "### How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "For method chaining to work, each method in the chain must return the instance of the class (`self`). This returns the object, and a subsequent method can be called on that same object. If a method in the chain returns a value other than `self`, the chain is broken, and no further methods can be called on the same object.\n",

        "    def add(self, number):\n",
        "        self.result += number\n",
        "        return self  # Return self to enable chaining\n",
        "\n",
        "    def subtract(self, number):\n",
        "        self.result -= number\n",

        "# Output: 13\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `add` and `subtract` methods return `self`, allowing us to chain the calls. The `get_result` method, which is the last one in the chain, returns the final value, which is then assigned to `final_result`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Significance\n",
        "\n",
        "The main significance of method chaining is that it makes code more readable and expressive, especially when performing a sequence of operations on an object. It reduces the need for multiple lines of code, temporary variables, and can make the logic of a program more apparent. This pattern is commonly seen in libraries for data manipulation and web development."

        "\n",
        "ans:The `__call__` method in Python allows an object to be called like a function. If a class defines `__call__`, its instances can be invoked with parentheses `()` and arguments, just like a regular function. This turns an object into a \"callable object\" or \"functor.\"\n",

        "### How It Works\n",

        "When you call an object (e.g., `my_object()`), Python's interpreter looks for the `__call__` method on that object and executes it. Any arguments passed during the call are passed directly to the `__call__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",

        "\n",
        "In this example, the `double` object, which is an instance of `Multiplier`, is called with the argument `5`. This triggers the `__call__` method, which multiplies `5` by the `factor` (which is `2`), returning `10`.\n",

        "The `__call__` method is useful for several design patterns and scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Stateful Functions**: It allows you to create function-like objects that can maintain state. In the example above, the `double` object \"remembers\" its `factor` of `2`.\n",
        "  * **Decorators**: It's often used to create decorator classes that need to store state or be more flexible than simple functions.\n",
        "  * **Creating Closures**: It can be used to achieve the same effect as closures, where a function remembers and has access to variables from an enclosing scope.\n",
        "  * **Simplifying Complex Operations**: It can be used to make complex objects behave intuitively. For instance, a neural network object might use `__call__` to perform a forward pass on input data."
