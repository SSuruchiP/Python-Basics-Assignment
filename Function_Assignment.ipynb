        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, a **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task and can be called independently using its name. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can exist either inside or outside of classes. A **method**, on the other hand, is a function that is associated with an object and is defined within a class. Methods implicitly take the instance of the class (commonly referred to as `self`) as their first parameter, allowing them to access and modify the object's attributes. While all methods are functions, not all functions are methods. The key difference lies in how they are called and used—functions operate independently, whereas methods are tied to class instances and typically operate on the data within those objects.\n"

        "\n",
        "Ans:In Python, **parameters** and **arguments** are related concepts used in functions, but they serve different roles. **Parameters** are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values the function needs to perform its task. For example, in `def greet(name):`, `name` is a parameter. **Arguments**, on the other hand, are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called. For example, in `greet(\"Suruchi\")`, the string `\"Suruchi\"` is the argument provided to the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python supports different types of arguments such as **positional arguments**, **keyword arguments**, **default arguments**, and **variable-length arguments** (`*args` and `**kwargs`). Positional arguments must be in the correct order, keyword arguments are passed using parameter names, default arguments provide fallback values, and variable-length arguments allow passing a flexible number of inputs. Together, parameters and arguments make functions dynamic and reusable, allowing them to work with different data each time they are called.\n"

        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: In Python, functions can be defined and called in various ways to suit different programming needs. The most common way is using the `def` keyword to create a named function, which is then called by its name followed by parentheses. Functions can also be defined with **default arguments**, where parameters are given default values to be used if no argument is provided during the call. Another approach is using **keyword arguments**, allowing arguments to be passed by explicitly naming the parameter, making the order of arguments flexible. Python also supports **variable-length arguments** using `*args` for a variable number of positional arguments and `**kwargs` for keyword arguments, providing great flexibility when the number of inputs is unknown. For simple one-line operations, **lambda functions** (anonymous functions) can be used, defined with the `lambda` keyword. Functions can also be **nested**, where a function is defined inside another, and can access the outer function's scope. Additionally, **recursive functions**, which call themselves, are useful for tasks like calculating factorials or traversing trees. These various ways of defining and calling functions make Python a powerful language for both simple and complex tasks.\n"

        "ans:The `return` statement in a Python function is used to send the result or output of the function back to the caller. It ends the execution of the function and provides a value that can be stored in a variable, used in expressions, or passed to other functions. Without a `return` statement, a function will return `None` by default. The `return` statement allows a function to produce a result that can be reused elsewhere in the program, making the code more modular and efficient. Additionally, it can return multiple values as a tuple, enabling the function to provide more than one result at a time.\n"

        "\n",
        "Ans:In Python, an **iterable** is any object that can be looped over, such as lists, tuples, strings, sets, or dictionaries. These objects implement the `__iter__()` method, which returns an **iterator**. An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data; it implements both `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. The `__next__()` method returns the next item from the sequence each time it's called, and raises a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more items.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key difference between **iterables** and **iterators** is that iterables can be passed to the `iter()` function to get an iterator, but they themselves do not keep track of the current position during iteration. Iterators, on the other hand, remember their state as they move through the data. In simple terms, iterables are like books (they can be read), while iterators are like bookmarks (they keep track of where you are while reading).\n"

        "Ans:In Python, **generators** are a special type of iterable that allow you to generate values one at a time using the `yield` keyword, rather than storing them all in memory like a list. This makes generators very efficient for handling large datasets or streams of data because they produce values **on the fly** and only when needed (lazy evaluation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are defined like regular functions using the `def` keyword, but instead of `return`, they use `yield` to return a value. Each time the generator's `__next__()` method is called (either manually or through a loop), it resumes from where it left off, preserving its internal state. For example:\n",
